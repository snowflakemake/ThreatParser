[Threat Summary]

Between June 18–24, 2025, our SOC observed a targeted intrusion against multiple finance-sector endpoints in Northern Europe. The threat activity is attributed to the APT group "Gold Falcon", known for conducting espionage-motivated attacks against government and banking institutions.

[Initial Access and Execution]

The initial vector was a spear-phishing campaign delivering malicious documents exploiting CVE-2024-21412. When executed, the document launched a heavily obfuscated PowerShell script (T1059) to download the second-stage payload from:

- http://secure-update-gateway[.]com/install.bin
- https://cdn.exploit-sinkhole[.]org/loader.ps1

The payload was saved as `C:\Users\Public\winupdate.exe` and is identified by the SHA256 hash:

`cb1553a3c88817e4cc774a5a93f9158f6785bd3815447d04b6c3f4c2c4b21ed7`

[Lateral Movement and Credential Access]

Post-exploitation, the adversary used WMI and PsExec for lateral movement (T1021). Credential dumping was achieved via a modified version of Mimikatz (T1003) executed from memory.

Observed internal beaconing was directed to:

- 45.76.200.55 (unresolved)
- 161.35.12.88 (hosted in New Jersey, US)

[Persistence and Defense Evasion]

Persistence was established using registry run keys (T1547) and the creation of a scheduled task named “WinServiceUpdate” running daily at login.

To evade detection, attackers used:

- Binary padding (T1027.001)
- DLL side-loading (T1574.002)
- Process injection (T1055)

[Exfiltration and Impact]

Sensitive customer data was compressed using `7z.exe` and exfiltrated over HTTPS (T1041) to the following endpoint:

- https://data-sync-reporting[.]com/upload

[Risk Assessment]

Due to the group’s TTPs and targeting profile, we assess with high confidence this intrusion is part of a broader campaign against European financial institutions.
